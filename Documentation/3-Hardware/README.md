### Printing the Turret!
CAD/STL files have been moved to their own repo to save space.

Bradon has modeled a life-size version of the level 1 turrent. The model has been split down to fit on the printbed of an Ender 3: 220x220x250

Head to [Bradon's CAD REPO](https://github.com/ConvexBurrito5/TF2SentryCAD) to begin printing the body and the wrangler.
