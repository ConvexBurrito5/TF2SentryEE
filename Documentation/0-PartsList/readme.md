### What version should you create?
It depends on what you have lying around the house.

Both are going to be expensive... 
However, if you have either a spare Pi5 or a spare laptop that can be used will help point you in the right direction.

- A laptop/PC = more performance oriented.
- A RaspberryPI5 = slightly simpler circuit.
