Interesting thing to note...

1. combating noise

best practice of 1uF cap
universal ground
the best choice is to place a 220uF cap (electrolyte) and one 100nF cap (ceramic) between VCC and GND power lines.

on the input of an speaker , there must be no DC voltage (otherwise it will heat) so you shouldn't place any caps there.

on the I2C lines. there shouldn't be any capacitance, too.

and always be careful about radiation on the I2C lines.

try to shorten the wires as much as possible.
